In this mini project, I attempt to classify regions of the earths surface based on satellite images. I will be classifying these regions into the following classes:

Urban
Agricultural
Rangeland
Forest
Water
Barren
Dataset description
The training datset consists of 803 satellite images in jpg format each paired with a mask in png format that includes the classification of each individual pixel in to one of the 6 classes above. More information about the dataset can be [found in this paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06561)

## A full report of my findings can be [found here.](https://www.overleaf.com/project/65f8a88bf76a4e7312826ca8)
### Abstract:
This study focuses on employing Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) for image classification and segmentation tasks. Our primary objectives include developing
machine learning algorithms for binary image classification to identify specific land types within satellite imagery. Additionally, the aim is to devise algorithms capable of estimating the fractional composition of each land
class present in the image, providing insights into land
cover composition. Furthermore, there is an objective to
implement algorithms for pixel-level image segmentation
to accurately delineate land classes within satellite imagery.
Moreover, this study investigates the challenges associated with imbalanced class distributions in CNN-based
land cover classification. Imbalanced class distributions,
where certain classes are over-represented compared to
others, can lead to biased outcomes. By addressing these
challenges, our study aims to enhance the reliability and
accuracy of land cover classification using CNNs.
