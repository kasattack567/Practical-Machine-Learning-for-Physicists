Mini Project: Classifying Land Usage From Satellite Images

Satellite imagery serves as a crucial tool in contemporary Earth observation, offering valuable insights into
land cover and land use dynamics. Automated classification and segmentation of land cover are essential for
various applications such as agriculture, forestry management, and urban planning. Additionally, accurate land
use and land cover (LULC) classification using machine
learning has become increasingly vital for sustainable resource management in developing cities.
This study focuses on employing Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) for image classification and segmentation tasks. Our primary objectives include developing
machine learning algorithms for binary image classification to identify specific land types within satellite imagery. Additionally, the aim is to devise algorithms capable of estimating the fractional composition of each land
class present in the image, providing insights into land
cover composition. Furthermore, there is an objective to
implement algorithms for pixel-level image segmentation
to accurately delineate land classes within satellite imagery.
Moreover, this study investigates the challenges associated with imbalanced class distributions in CNN-based
land cover classification. Imbalanced class distributions,
where certain classes are over-represented compared to
others, can lead to biased outcomes. By addressing these
challenges, our study aims to enhance the reliability and
accuracy of land cover classification using CNNs.
